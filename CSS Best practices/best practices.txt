CSS Best Practices

elements/classes in a container are referred to as children
wrapping one child in a div and using justify-content: space-between; will send both children to either side of the parent (container)


USE INSPECT ELEMENT TO MAKE SURE ELEMENTS HAVE SPACE TO MOVE

padding will create space inside border
margin will create space outside

* {
box-sizing: border-box;
} will keep everything in line nicely

flex-wrap is good for laying boxes out in rows next to each other

WHEN CODING WIDTH NEVER HARDCODE IT, do 
width: 100%;
max-width: 600px;

margin: 0 auto; - centers it for you
 ROWS cap the sides
